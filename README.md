# ItemsAPI 

<a href="https://www.itemsapi.com" target="_blank">ItemsAPI</a> is restful search api written in node.js and elasticsearch.

The goal of this project is creating advanced search application without spending time for backend. You just provide json data and your backend is ready to go. You don't need to be node.js developer to use it.

With ItemsAPI you can create very easily:
- various list and catalogs (restaurants, movies, gyms, doctors, places)
- simple recommendation system (i.e. users who like this also like)

This backend offers functionality like:
- full text searching
- generating facets / aggregations out of the box
- showing similar items (based on collaborative filtering algorithm)
- generating nice urls for fields (permalinks) out of the box
- geo sorting

## Requirement
- node.js
- java
- elasticsearch > 1.4 < 2.0
