# ItemsAPI 
The goal of this project is creating advanced search application without spending time for backend. You just provide configuration and data and your backend is ready to go. You don't need to be node.js developer to use it.

With ItemsAPI you can create very easily:
- various catalogs (restaurants, gyms, doctors, foods)
- autocomplete and simple recommendation system for ecommerce
- songs and movies recommendation

ItemsAPI is restful backend best for:
- javascript frameworks (angular.js, meteor.js, react.js)
- mobile (ios, android)
 
This backend will offer powerful functionality like:
- full text searching
- autocomplete
- simple recommendation
- geo searching
- field types like standard (int, string, etc) and custom (image, rating, geo, tags)
