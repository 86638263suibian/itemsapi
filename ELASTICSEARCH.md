# How to get working Elasticsearch 

The most used Elasticsearch version for ItemsAPI is 1.7.x so it is also recommended. 

## Manual installation

- Ubuntu 14.04 https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-elasticsearch-on-ubuntu-14-04

## Cloud version

- https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/ - if you have AWS account this is the easiest way to start ES. 
It is also paid per hour so great for experimenting.
- https://www.digitalocean.com/ - there is no Elasticsearch package but it is relatively easy to create new server (i.e. Ubuntu 14.04).
You can also make tests, experiments and make server snapshot for further use
